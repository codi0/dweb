# dWeb research hub
Welcome to the [codi.io](https://codi.io) research hub into infrastructure for the decentralised web.

### Our mission

To decentralise the web's computing infrastructure. We believe in an open, self-sovereign web that gives people control over their own data and provides opportunity for the many, not the few.

We're creating a dWeb platform for developers, built using the best open-source decentralised solutions, to enable seamless creation and deployment of fully decentralised applications.

### How can I get involved?

Join our [developer community](https://codi.io/discord) to ask questions, share your ideas, and get involved in creating a developer platform for the dWeb.

### What problem are we trying to solve?

Decentralised web technologies have developed significantly over the last decade; promising benefits such as censorship resistance, user-owned data, enchanced security, better privacy and 100% availability. These benefits are being labelled in various ways, including "web3", "web5" and "dWeb".

However, there are still significant challenges to overcome to compete with traditional "web2" solutions, typically comprising of vast centralised computing infrastructure and services, controlled by a small number of large corporations (AWS, GCP, Azure etc). They are low cost, fast, scalable and convenient.

By contrast, the dWeb ecosystem, and the interoperable standards necessary for it to function effectively, is still in its infancy. We seek to understand what a truly open, standards-based dWeb infrastructure might look like, and bring together the best solutions to realise that vision.

> As a web developer, I want to develop and run decentralised, performant software as easily as I can run software on AWS.

### Key questions to address

1. What might an open, global dWeb infrastructure look like?
2. What existing protocols would be well suited to making up that infrastructure, and are there still gaps to fill?
3. Can we create a working implementation of that joined-up infrastructure that is easy for anyone to run?

### Some guiding principles

1. All parts of the infrastructure should use standards-based, open-source protocols and libraries
2. Infrastructure should be modular by design, such that specific implementations can be swapped or extended
3. Operational complexities and protocol integrations should be abstracted away from the end-developer
4. Any computer should be able to help run the infrastructure, and be fairly compensated for doing so
5. I should be able to run a public or private instance of the infrastructure
6. I should be able to code software in any programming languages of my choosing

### The dWeb ecosystem

We're mapping out the layers emerging in the dWeb ecosystem, so we can fully understand and embrace its potential:

### A conceptual example

This is a simplified view of how different protocols might be combined to form a decentralised infrastructure. This is meant as a starting point for discussion, not a finalised concept.
