# Web3 research hub
Welcome to the [codi.io](https://codi.io) collaborative research hub into open web3 infrastructure.

### Our mission

To decentralise the world's computing infrastructure. We believe in an open web3 tech stack, composed of standards-based protocols and not reliant on centralised cloud providers, that provides opportunity for every developer.

There are many potential solutions emerging across the decentralised web, both on-chain and off-chain. We imagine our platform as a hub that will integrate the best of these solutions, to create a seamless experience for deploying completely decentralised applications.

### What problem are we trying to solve?

Decentralised web technologies have developed significantly over the last decade; promising benefits such as censorship resistance, user-owned data, enchanced security, better privacy and 100% availability. The benefits of the decentralised web are becoming known as "web3".

However, there are still significant challenges to overcome to compete with traditional "web2" solutions, typically comprising of vast centralised computing infrastructure and services, controlled by a small number of large corporations (AWS, GCP, Azure etc). They are low cost, fast, scalable and convenient.

By contrast, the web3 ecosystem, and the interoperable standards necessary for it to function effectively, is still in its infancy. We seek to understand what a truly open, standards-based web3 infrastructure might look like, and bring together the best solutions to realise that vision.

> As a web developer, I want to develop and run decentralised, performant software as easily as I can run software on AWS.

### Key questions to address

1. What might an open, global web3 infrastructure look like?
2. What existing protocols would be well suited to making up that infrastructure, and are there still gaps to fill?
3. Can we create a working implementation of that joined-up infrastructure that is easy for anyone to run?

### Some guiding principles

1. All parts of the infrastructure should use standards-based, open-source protocols and libraries
2. Infrastructure should be modular by design, such that specific implementations can be swapped or extended
3. Operational complexities and protocol integrations should be abstracted away from the end-developer
4. Any computer should be able to help run the infrastructure, and be fairly compensated for doing so
5. I should be able to run a public or private instance of the infrastructure
6. I should be able to code software in any programming languages of my choosing

### A conceptual example

A very simplified high-level view, from developer and end user perspectives, of how different protocols might be combined to form a decentralised infrastructure. This is meant as a starting point for discussion, not a finalised concept.

### How can I get involved?

First off, have a look at our [web3 ecosystem map](https://codi.io/web3). It paints a picture of the different web3 layers, and examples of existing projects within each layer. The map will keep evolving as we progress.

Then check out our [open discussions](https://github.com/codi0/research/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adiscussion) to share your thoughts on the vision and get involved in research and prototyping. We'd also appreciate if you shared this repo with anyone else you think might be interested.

This is an entirely open-source endeavour. As we progress, we'll also look at how to formalise and incentivise member contributions (E.g. through creation of a DAO).
