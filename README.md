# Web3 research hub
Welcome to the [codi.io](https://codi.io) collaborative research hub into open web3 infrastructure.

### Our mission

To replace centralised cloud platforms with a global web3 infrastructure, using standardised protocols.

### What problem are we trying to solve?

Decentralised web technologies have developed significantly over the last decade; promising benefits that include censorship restistance, user-owned data, enchanced security, better privacy and 100% availability. The benefits of the decentralised web are becoming known as "web3".

However, there are still significant challenges to overcome for the decentralised web to compete with traditional "web2" solutions, typically comprising of vast centralised computing infrastructure, controlled by a small number of large corporations (AWS, GCP, Azure etc). They are low cost, fast, scalable and convenient.

By contrast, the web3 ecosystem is still in its infancy, with different projects and protocols vying for supremacy, as expected in an emergent area of technology. We seek to understand what a truly open, standards-based web3 infrastructure might look like, and bring together the best solutions to realise that vision.

> As a web developer, I want to develop and run decentralised, performant software as easily as I can run software on AWS.

### Key questions to address

1.) What might an open, global web3 infrastructure look like?

2.) What existing protocols would be well suited to making up that infrastructure, and are there still gaps to fill?

3.) Can we create a working implementation of that joined-up infrastructure that is easy for anyone to run?

### How can I get involved?

We recommend first having a look at our [web3 ecosystem map](https://codi.io/web3). It paints a picture of the different web3 layers, and examples of existing projects within each layer. The map will keep evolving as we progress.

Then head over to our [discussion board](https://github.com/codi0/research/discussions) to share your thoughts and ideas. If there's a particular area you're interested in and want to help research, we welcome any and all contributions.

This is an entirely open-source endeavour. As we progress, we'll also look at how to formalise and incentivise member contributions (E.g. through creation of a DAO).
